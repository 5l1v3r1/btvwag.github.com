The Burlington area is full of passionate folks who grow our diverse software community by organizing free educational networking events. Whether you are a college student or just new to the area, you may want to get involved, but not know how. This unique event will focus on giving students and other community members an opportunity to get to know each other. Find out what college students are learning these days, what sort of opportunities our community has, and maybe find that you or your company has a perfect internship opening that you did not previously realize. 

### Introduction (6:30pm - 7pm)

Members of Burlington Web App Group (BTVWAG) will kick off the evening with a short presentation on resources in the Burlington area that are available for the purpose of education and networking, as well as some tips and tricks for getting the most out of them.

### Networking (7pm - 8pm)

The presentation will be followed by a casual networking activity, which will be structured as a round robin. Pairs of people will get a chance to talk just long enough to find out the important stuff, then everyone will move on to the next person.  Although we are encouraging computer science college students to join us, this is also a good chance to get to know your fellow professionals as well!

### Wrap Up (8pm - 8:30pm)

Lastly, we will have some non-structured networking time for you to follow up on anything promising or meet new people.
