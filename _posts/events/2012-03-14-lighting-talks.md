Please join us for a lightning talk round of presentations.  

The presenter schedule is still under development, but expect to listen and participate in a series of presentations by fellow web application developers as they get a few minutes to highlight:

* Demo of their web app
* Technologies used
* How they scaled for users (or plan to scale)

This talk will be a bit different then previous events, as our goal is to spend no more than 7 - 10 minutes on any one speaker.

Stay tuned for more details...
