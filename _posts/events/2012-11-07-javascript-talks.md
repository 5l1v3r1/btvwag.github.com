Please join us for another lightning talk round of presentations!

Each individual gets 15-20 minutes, followed by a group question & answer period when all presentations are completed.

Hope to see you there!

### Presentations include:

#### Patrick Berkeley - Better Callbacks with Deferred Object

Learn how to use the deferred object 1) to cleanup callbacks, 2) for caching,
3) for orchestrating multiple animations. We'll cover the basics of the
CommonJS Promises/A pattern as it's implemented in jQuery.

#### Dan Bowles - Object Oriented JavaScript

Dan will be speaking on OOJS, prototypes and useful patterns when dealing with them.
He is a developer on the Web Architecture team at Dealer.com.  Lover of The Web, Bacon and LEGO bricks.

#### Tristan O'Neil - PJAX: Full Page Reloads Are For Suckers

Everybody wants their web app to be fast. On the client side this can be solved
in a variety of ways. Wouldn't it be nice to solve it with no (or very little)
effort? PJAX is AJAX + pushSate. PJAX fetches HTML from your web server and
loads it into the current page without a full page reload. The speed of AJAX
and the usability of a regular HTML page, real permalinks, page titles, and a working back button.
