#### John Need - Build a web-app in 20 minutes with Ember.js

Ember.js is a JavaScript web application framework with built-in
two-way data binding.

#### Tristan O'Neil - CoffeeScript: A Brief Introduction

The creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich was quoted as saying "JS had to 'look like Java'
only less so, be Javaâ€™s dumb kid brother or boy-hostage sidekick. Plus, I had to be done
in ten days or something worse than JS would have happened.". This is where CoffeeScript
comes in. CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles to JavaScript that attempts to
bring beauty and a little sanity to JavaScript. In this talk we'll explore the basics of
this language and why you might benefit from using it.
