BTVWAG x BurlingtonJS presents the Front-end Framework Face-off. The meetup
will feature four speakers. Three will be covering the major front-end
frameworks right now: Ember, Angular and Backbone (+ Marionette); the last
speaker will be covering front-end JavaScript with no framework.

February 12th is the date.

The location is yet to be announced. We need to gauge the interest of the meetup
to select a space that accommodates the number attendees. If you are interested,
please RSVP sooner rather than later.

We are looking for a pizza and juice sponsor for the event, so if you are
interested please let us know.

The speakers:

* Ember - Peter Brown of Agilion
* Angular - Rob Friesel of Dealer.com
* Backbone (+ Marionette) - Alan Peabody of Agilion
* No framework - Ian Metcalf of Draker

The format:

* 20 minutes per framework - covering the good, the bad and the ugly
* 30 minutes of Q&A moderated by Brett Chalupa

After the Q&A, let's all hangout downtown over some drinks!
