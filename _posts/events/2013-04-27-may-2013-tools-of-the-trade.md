### Presentations

#### Rebecca Grenier - How to use the Apache Solr Search Server in your Web Application (and why you might want to!)

Learn about the free Apache Solr search server and how it uses the Lucene Search Library to improve document search results.  This includes how to download and install it on your computer for development/practice and on a server for actual production use.  How to get documents into it from a MySQL database (and where to look for other document formats).  How to configure it to return precisely the most relevant search results to your users.  There are plugins & gems to aid in use of Apache Solr for many different types of sites including Wordpress, Joomla, and Drupal, or you can use its API to roll your own custom solution.

Rebecca Grenier is a Software Developer at EatingWell in Shelburne, VT where she works on their Drupal website as well as developing new web applications using backbone.js, coffeescript, Scala and the Play Framework.

#### Odie Routh and Alan Peabody - Chef + Vagrant

This talk will introduce two complimentary tools for automating your infrastructure, Vagrant and Chef. 

First we will touch on Vagrant and how it can integrate with your existing tools to standardize your development environments. Then we will dig into Chef and the power it provides to automate your infrastructure. With the two building blocks in place we will explain basic integration of the two tools. Finally we will wrap up by touching on some of the other amazing ways these two extremely powerful and versatile tools can be combined.
