### Presentations

#### Rebecca Grenier - How to use the Apache Solr Search Server in your Web Application (and why you might want to!)

Learn about the free Apache Solr search server and how it uses the Lucene Search Library to improve document search results.  This includes how to download and install it on your computer for development/practice and on a server for actual production use.  How to get documents into it from a MySQL database (and where to look for other document formats).  How to configure it to return precisely the most relevant search results to your users.  There are plugins & gems to aid in use of Apache Solr for many different types of sites including Wordpress, Joomla, and Drupal, or you can use its API to roll your own custom solution.
