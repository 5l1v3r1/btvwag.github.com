### Brandon Savage - Design Patterns

Design patterns. They strike fear in the heart of developers. Like wild animals they seem untamable, something best left to the most advanced object oriented developers. But you can master design patterns. I will show you how. Learn about some of the most essential design patterns for PHP developers to know and love, and find out how easy it is to use them in your own application. You'll have design patterns mastered in no time.
