Do you have any knowledge surrounding Couch, Mongo, Redis, Cassandra, Hbase, Riak, Neo4j, FlockDB or any other NoSQL database technology? Are you interested in learning about any of these technologies? BTVWAG is planning a November NoSQL Lightning Talks Meetup, and we are looking for members of the community who are passionate or interested in NoSQL databases to speak.
