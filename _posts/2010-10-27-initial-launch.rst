I attended my first BTVWAG meetup in Burlington today, where @bseanvt presented
to a group of about 15 web technology enthusiasts about Rails and Hadoop. After
his presentation, we started a discussion about the future format and content
of BTVWAG meetings. I was really excited by several of the potential future
formats, including: bring your problems from work days, lightning talks,
solving the same problem with different technologies, and regular old
presentations. I think that this varied format will provide a great atmosphere
and rich enough content to bring people in, and keep them coming back.
