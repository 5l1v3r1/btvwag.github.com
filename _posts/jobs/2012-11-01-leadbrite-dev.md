### Senior Software Developers

Here at LeadBrite we create simple and beautiful software and web apps that allow people to grow a large and devoted audience. We believe in giving people the tools for building healthier, more responsive lists (with integrity and in a way that serves both our customers and their market).

We're looking for a Front-End Developer who would love to have a remote/virtual position. 

Ideally you're a WordPress expert, but even if you have no experience with WordPress, you're not afraid! You know you can learn anything quickly and you’ll have it mastered in no time at all. You’re comfortable with small projects that need to be done quickly as well as large projects that requiring planning and long-term strategy.

You're not afraid to dig into the infrastructure that's built around marketing automation.

You love variety: one day you'll be creating a new sales page, the next day you'll be working on new product pages, the day after that you'll be creating entire websites from the ground up, and to round the week out you’ll be integrating a plugin into a visual design that had already been established, determined to make them play nicely together. Here are a few other examples of the type of work you'll be doing: 

* Taking existing CSS and HTML designs that were created by a third party service and modifying/adapting them to fit a pre-existing web page.
* Developing systems to streamline the work we do, and handling "admin" tasks including backups of all our sites.
* Overseeing the security of our many sites.
* Updating our membership sites with sometimes tricky software.

But the best trait of all that you possess is a tenacity that says, "I am able to wrestle any problem to the ground and conquer it." Your work with us will have a direct impact on our success. If that excites you, we'd love to hear from you.
