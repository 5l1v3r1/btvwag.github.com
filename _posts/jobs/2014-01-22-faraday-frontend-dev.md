Faraday is a newly funded Vermont startup bringing rigor, science, and machine learning to customer acquisition in the solar, efficiency, and home improvement industries.

We're building a classy app and we need front-end talent to make it happen.

We want:

1. a gal or guy who has gone deep into one tech - whatever it is. Maybe you do audio signal processing in Python or you wrote the book on jQuery or you can describe strict mode Javascript in excruciating detail. You don't need to know everything or immediately pick up the new trend. Turing complete is Turing complete... 
2. somebody who has opinions about the directory structure of Javascript apps. Our existing team could pick up Angular or Ember and make it run, but we want somebody who has done it before and has made as many mistakes as possible.

Our team has stuck together for 6 years and we're ready to explore new territory with a new member in our Vermont based office. We're offering a competitive salary, benefits, and options. 

Please send us your Github username or some other way to see your open source work.
