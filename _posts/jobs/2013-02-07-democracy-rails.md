### Ruby on Rails Web Developer

Our data team is looking for a sharp, professional web developer to
assist in coding our primary website, managing the flow of our data
and making some of our wackiest online ideas live. We use Ruby on
Rails as our core technology (though it’s OK if you don’t yet speak
Ruby, we’d be excited to teach you), and aspire to function as a
best-in-class small web shop embedded within an organization that does
great things. We're not a non-profit trying to cobble together a web
presence with a shoestring budget, nor are we a stodgy government
agency moving at a glacial pace. We do great work using modern
methodologies, and we take pride in the code we craft.

Salary starts at $60,000 and is commensurate with experience.
