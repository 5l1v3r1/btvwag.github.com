### Web Developer

We are looking for a full-time Developer for our Burlington, Vermont, studio to work on internal JDK-owned web properties as well as digital and interactive projects for our clients. The qualified candidate will have hands-on coding experience creating solutions using PHP-based products or frameworks and a solid foundation in the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and model-view-controller (MVC) systems. Demonstrated experience in coding web user interfaces using modern and standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required. Experience developing mobile solutions (both web and app), working-level knowledge of a variety of programming languages, and experience building highly functional web applications, including eCommerce and CMS-driven sites, strongly preferred.

This position requires a fundamental understanding of user-experience best practices, the ability to effectively implement detailed visual designs on engagements, and the skills to code the underlying back-end technical solutions across a variety of platforms and frameworks for our clients. The Programmer will work closely with in-house project managers, strategists, and designers to create innovative digital experiences, making use of new and emerging technologies. We are seeking a strong team player with a thorough understanding of graphic design, information architecture, and data management who also possesses strong written and verbal communication skills. A degree in computer science or a related field is preferred, along with at least 2 years' professional experience coding for the web.
