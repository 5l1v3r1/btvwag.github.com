### LeadPages - Senior Software Developer (Remote)

Hi, we're LeadPages and we create beautiful software and web apps that allow businesses to grow large and devoted audiences (and their lists of leads).

We're looking for an amazing Senior Software Developer who has turbo-charged skills, thinks deeply about the best solutions, and wants to work with a fantastic team of people. You'll need to be a dynamic person that has a unique combination of skills, talents and mindset. We have a few stellar developers already on our team and are looking to add one more. The best part? This is a virtual position, so you can live and work anywhere in the world. 

THIS IS BIG:

There's no obstacle you can't find a way around. Anything you don't know, you can teach yourself—and you love doing so.

You will be working from your home, but will be an integral part of an amazing team. 

We genuinely enjoy and respect each other–and have a hell of a good time working together. You must be able to talk on Skype for weekly meetings.

**You must have substantial experience in Python and Javascript.**

In addition, you have at least a handful of these:
* stellar web development skills (HTML and CSS)
* great interest in user experience and usability
* an entrepreneurial nature
* experience with Mercurial and other version control systems
* extensive knowledge of classic programming rules ... so that you can break them --when the situation calls for it
* scaleable web development experience

You'll always be treated with respect, will laugh a lot throughout the day and will get to work with a great team including the co-founders, (who like to swear, but never at you!).

SOUND LIKE YOU?
