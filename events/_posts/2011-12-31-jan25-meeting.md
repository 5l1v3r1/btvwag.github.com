Please [register](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2704307657) and join us on Jan 25th, 2012 from 6:30 - 8:30 pm  for a presentation and discussion on building rich web applications with JavaScript MVC frameworks. Presented by Agilion Apps.

The world of Model-View-Controller (MVC) style javascript frameworks is quickly changing and while [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) appears to be leading the way there are some other real contenders.  Join us as we explore [Shopify's](http://www.shopify.com/) entry into the arena, [Batman.js](http://batmanjs.org/). Batman.js is a framework for building rich web applications with JavaScrip or CoffeeScript.  Batmans.js is following in the footsteps of Ruby on Rails and values convention over configuration.  Allowing you to write elegant JavaScript applications without all the boilerplate.

The presentation and discussion will be led by the [Agilion Apps team](http://agilionapps.com/team) members including Tristan O'Neil, Adam Bouchard and Sean Behan.

If you have any questions, please contact Adam ( adam at agilionapps.com ).

Hope to see you there.
